            The subject found in the pull request title
            didn't match the configured pattern. Please ensure that the subject
            starts with an uppercase character (e.g., "Add feature" or "Fix bug").
            Note: Dependabot PRs are automatically fixed by the auto-fix-pr-title workflow.
